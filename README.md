# R-blood-rhesus : a data-centric story stelling experience

A Rmarkdown report on blood rhesus, all in pure  R (no addition csv nor database required). To play with it, just open the [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and compile it to get the output Rapport.

# Inception

Once at lunchtime with colleagues we began to talk about [blood giving](http://www.adsbnc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=7), and we finally were asking ourselves who could give to who, etc... We rapidly noticed that we were not really aware of that.
I started to think about a set of infographic, data based, on this specific topic. As i was beginning to look around R, i started this WE side project.
